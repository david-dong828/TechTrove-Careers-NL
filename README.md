**Notes:**                  
- *An issue that is happening on Vercel right now*
  - I have integrated PlanetScale as an alternative to MySQL.
  - However, due to the limitations of Vercel's serverless environment, our data scraping functionality is currently non-operational. This is because Google Chrome, which is essential for the scraping process, is not available in this environment.
  - Despite this setback, you can still explore the application's user interface by visiting the provided link. https://tech-trove-careers-nl.vercel.app/
  - I am actively exploring potential solutions and will update the application if I manage to resolve this issue.
- Currently you can Run **index.py** to test
  - for your test, make sure you have **local MySQL or PlanetScale**
  - and you also need to choose correct database setting on *database_handle.py*

- Now Supports: **Verafin, Colab, Mysa, Vission33, AvalonHolographics, PolyUnity, Enaimco**
- Will add more tech companies
